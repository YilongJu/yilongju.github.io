Welcome to my homepage! Iâ€™m a 4th year CS PhD student at Rice University, advised by Prof. [Ankit Patel](https://ankitlab.co/).

My research focuses on building and improving machine learning and deep learning models for science problems in an explainable way. The fields of subjects involve quantum many-body physics, computational chemical sensing, medicine, etc. To be more specific, I build models that do not require too much domain knowledge but are able to learn and exploit various types of data in different fields of Science. I aim to increase the interpretability of these models while maintaining the same level of performance. Recently I found that sometimes it is possible to achieve the goal without neural networks - just use neural-networks inspired procedures and learn from their success.

I received my Master's degree from University of Pennsylvania, where I studied Data Science and worked with Prof. [Shivani Agarwal](https://www.shivani-agarwal.net/) on Learning the Tree Structure of a Nested Logit Choice Model from Data. I also worked for Prof. [Barry Silverman](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~barryg/) on Addressing Disparities in Healthcare Access and Outcomes among Chronically Ill Older Adults: Assessing the Feasibility of an Agent-Based Modeling Approach ([visualization](https://vnsnyupenn.shinyapps.io/vnsny-upenn-abms-study-r-map/) of the geographic data used in the project). I received my Bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University, where I studied Industrial Engineering.

Out of all my hobbies, I'm proudest of my efforts in music composition. I was a bassoon and saxophone player in Tsinghua University Symphonic Band and hence I had the opportunity to write pieces for different sizes of bands, from woodwind duets, saxophone quartets, woodwind quintets, to the full band. In my last year as an undergrad, I rearranged the La La Land Suite and it was performed on our annual concert ([video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1se411s7G8?p=3)). In my spare time, I also play tennis, video games, and go hiking. My favorite singer is [Kotoha](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ql_EU4JnaE3Rh3cqbHu6g).
